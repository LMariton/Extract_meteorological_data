Scripts to extract meteorological data

# ExtractingT_Mean.R
This script extracts the raw mean temperature and the mean anomaly (in Â°C) at sites for given dates.
Those sites have to be in metropolitan France (and Corsica) (if needed, minor changes will allow to use this script for European sites outside France).
It uses the E-Obs meteorological data: https://surfobs.climate.copernicus.eu/dataaccess/access_eobs.php#datafiles

# ExtractingPrecipitations.R
This script allows to extract the precipitations sum (in mm) at sites for given dates.
Those sites have to be in metropolitan France (and Corsica) (if needed, minor changes will allow to use this script for European sites outside France).
It uses the E-Obs meteorological data: https://surfobs.climate.copernicus.eu/dataaccess/access_eobs.php#datafiles
